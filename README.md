# ClassifyGalaxies
A project I completed as part of UC Berkeley's ASTRO AY250 [Python Computing for Data Science](https://github.com/profjsb/python-seminar "AY250 github"). Here I use a convolutional neural net to classify galaxies based on their physical attributes. The dataset can be found [here](https://astronn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/galaxy10.html). The images come from the [DESI survey](https://www.legacysurvey.org/) and were classified by citizen scientists on [Galaxy Zoo](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/).
